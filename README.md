## About Python 

Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both simple and powerful.
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python's elegant syntax and dynamic typing, 
together with its interpreted nature,make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
